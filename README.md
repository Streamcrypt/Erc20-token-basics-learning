### About
---
This repository contains a basic ERC20 token implementation and a simple staking contract to demonstrate how tokens and staking logic interact.

* **Erc20\_token.sol** → A minimal ERC20-compliant token with balances, transfers, approvals, and allowances.
* **SimpleStaking.sol** → A staking contract that allows users to stake and unstake the ERC20 token after approval.

The repo is intended for learning and experimenting with ERC20 mechanics and staking flow (approve → stake → unstake).
